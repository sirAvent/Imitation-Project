			<h2><u>Reasons Why The Official Story Does Not Hold</u></h2>

					<li>
						The Gates Foundation held an exact simulation on the Coronavirus, 
						<a target="_blank" href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/about">
						Event 201, 
						</a>
						months before the real outbreak.
						The similation brought important information such as the time to develop a vaccine and case numbers. With such an accurate 
						simulation, there would've been no way for the actual virus to outbreak.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						The Coronavirus is a manmade virus, despite the media claiming it came from animals. The virus originated from

			<h2><u>COVID-19 Is China's Population Control</u></h2>
		
			<p>
				<img width ="250" height="175px" alt="Overpopulation" src="https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/overpopulation-crowd.jpg">
				<br><br>
				Human numbers continue to skyrocket in the last century. Resource shortages, climate change, poverty, and population rise as the population
				continues to grow. Problems have placed enormous pressure on governments to solve the issues. However, solving overpopulation is not an easy task.
				<br><br>
			</p>
			</center>
			<p>
				<strong>Here is the solution:</strong>
			</p>
			<center>
			<p>
				China, one the world's most populated nations behind India, created the Coronavirus to effectively control their population.
				Remember the one child policy in China? It was a law that restricted families to only have one child to order to maintain the growth of their population.
				This law is no longer implemented, and perhaps the population have increased too much. At the same time, riots and protests have sparked in Hong Kong,
				protesting against Chinese control in Hong Kong and for an open and free democracy. China has a history of censoring political movements and since all eyes were on China during these protests,
				they had no other choice than to do nothing.
				<br>
				So what was China's solution to these problems? <b>The COVID-19 virus</b>, created in a lab as a bioweapon.
				The virus effectively killed a portion of China's population and infected many more. And for the protests in Hong Kong? The movement was weakened immensely. Without public gathering,
				it became hard for media to cover the protests, thus ending Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement to the global audience.
			</p>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<h2>U.S. Involvement</h2>
			<p>
				Evidence leads to Microsoft co-founder, Bill Gates, to be one of the figures behind the Coronavirus. In the past, he has
				given plenty of information regarding vaccines and viruses. For what reason would he promote vaccines and virus information?
				He has also been on the spotlight for many theories claiming that vaccines funded by him are made to alter human DNA for the government.
				We will be ignoring these theories because they are not relevant in this context.
			</p>
				<br><h3>The Connection</h3>
				<img width="300px" height="175px"alt="BLM" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9765477859f031afe596005d82bc7b4aa1d3a76c/0_106_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=2696dc415cc2d1d0a2fea61cb86a0abf">
			<p>
				We all know that the United States is a government with a history of oppression. Police brutality, especially against 
				African Americans, and white supremacy is still an ongoing issue in the states. The Black Lives Matter movement sprouted against police brutality and 
				the subtle racisms seen throughout society. Yet, we see very few acts for African Americans passed in Congress.
				<br>
				The U.S. sees an opportunity with the virus and deploys it in its cities. Here, we see African American communities getting hit the hardest.
				<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid19-racial-disparities">
				Disproportionate rates of COVID-19 illness
				</a>and death is reported within the community. Why is this so? The U.S. is using the virus to secretly oppress people of color. Just like President Nixon's operation
				to deploy crack cocaine in African American communities in the 70s the U.S. is doing something similar once again, this time with a deadly virus. This virus surely damaged
				public perception of the Black Lives Matter movement on media as masses of people seen on T.V. isn't a good image when lockdown orders were in place.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Former President Trump, with his anti-asian messages, has also helped push the U.S. operations to push back POCs. The past year, we have seen a huge increase
			in 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2021/02/16/attacks-against-asian-americans-spike-amid-pandemic">
			hate crimes towards Asian Americans.
			</a>
			Messages from the government, especially from the former President, has helped push these hate crimes. With Asian Americans
			being blamed as sources for this artificially created virus, the government accomplishes two things: hiding the fact that it is artificially created and prevents Asian Americans
			progressing in American society.
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3>What Does This Prove?</h3>
			<p>There is a <strong>hidden order</strong> in the U.S. government that utilizes the virus to push their racist ideology. For years, this order was involved in the U.S. history of racism and is still active today.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>Why Spreading the Truth is Important</h2>
			<img width="250px" height="170px" alt="UCI CS Building" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/UCI_Donald_Bren_Hall.jpg">
			<p>I am a graduate student at the University of California, Irvine and a proud citizen of the U.S. I am an Asian American involved in research for different viruses and was actually part of the team that looked into the coronavirus genome sequence here at Irvine. I very much WANT to believe that the Coronavirus is a virus that has spread worldwide because of
			unlucky circumstances that made it easy to spread. After carefully researching both sides I have concluded that this is an artificial virus made for mass population control.
			<br>
			<br>
			The U.S. Government always had a history of unequal treatment to POCs. That being said, we should strive for a better society where everyone is treated with respect. When is it time for us to say enough is enough?
			<br>
			<br>
			These governments have always mendled with their people. Whether its China or the U.S., they are always looking for more ways to try to control us. What if 
			the hunger for control stopped? Unjustice commited by the government will cease.
